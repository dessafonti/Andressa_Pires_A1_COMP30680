          Hey there, I'm Andressa, a proud Brazilian woman born and raised in
          the heart of a big Brazilian city. Since I was a kid, I've had this
          incredible connection with Brazilian culture, and it all began with my
          love for literature. When I was just 12 years old, I stumbled upon the
          mesmerizing writings of Clarice Lispector. Her introspective and
          thought-provoking stories struck a chord with me, and I couldn't get
          enough. It was as if she was speaking directly to me, unraveling the
          mysteries of life, emotions, and Brazil's identity. As I grew older, I
          eagerly dived into the enchanting worlds crafted by literary giants
          like Machado de Assis, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Marina Colassanti,
          Carolina Maria de Jesus, Manoel de Barros, Caio Fernando Abreu, and
          many more. Each of these writers painted a unique portrait of Brazil's
          history, culture, and society
        </p>

        <p>
          With a master's degree in Sociology, Literature and Education, I've
          been on a mission to highlight the incredible richness of Brazilian
          culture to the world. This project is just another example of my
          dedication to this cause. My journey through Brazilian literature and
          culture has not only shaped me personally but has also ignited a
          burning passion to share Brazil's precious heritage with a global
          audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that culture has the power to change lives and bridge gaps
          between people from different backgrounds. My goal is to inspire
          others to explore the profound beauty and depth of Brazil's artistic
          legacy, just as it has transformed my life.
        </p>
